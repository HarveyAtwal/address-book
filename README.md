## Address Book

The goal of this assignment is to create an address book using AngularJS. Contacts are listed on the left hand side, are searchable, and can be toggled to view their full details. Additionally, contacts can be editable in the main view.

Please install all node modules with this command:

> npm install
```
Note: that npm will automatically start installing bower components after the node modules are installed.
```

Run the server by using this command and view in browser at `http://localhost:8080`:
> npm start
```
Note: Prior to starting the node server, npm will automatically execute the build process
```

Use the following command to run tests:
> npm test

Use the following command to start the build process
